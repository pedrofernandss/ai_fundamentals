# 💬 Sentiment Analysis

> Modeling sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) in textual data using machine learning and deep learning methods.

---

## 🧩 Concepts
Sentiment Analysis detects emotional tone or opinion in text.  
This module explores:
- Logistic Regression baseline
- Deep models (LSTM)
- Transformer-based classification (BERT)
- Dataset preprocessing and evaluation

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Plan
- [ ] Preprocess text (tokenization, cleaning)
- [ ] Train **Logistic Regression** baseline with TF-IDF
- [ ] Build **LSTM classifier**
- [ ] Fine-tune **BERT** on sentiment dataset
- [ ] Compare performance across methods

---

## 🧮 Key Metrics
