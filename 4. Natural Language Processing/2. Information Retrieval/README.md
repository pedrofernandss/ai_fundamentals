# üîé Information Retrieval

> From keyword search to semantic retrieval ‚Äî connecting queries and documents through vector representations.

## üß© Concepts
Information Retrieval (IR) focuses on finding relevant documents given a query.

Covered topics:
- Vector Space Model (TF-IDF)
- BM25 ranking
- Query expansion
- Semantic search with embeddings (e.g. BERT)
- Evaluation metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, nDCG

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Plan
- [ ] Build a **TF-IDF-based search engine** using scikit-learn
- [ ] Implement **BM25** ranking
- [ ] Experiment with **semantic search** using sentence embeddings
- [ ] Evaluate ranking performance with standard IR metrics
