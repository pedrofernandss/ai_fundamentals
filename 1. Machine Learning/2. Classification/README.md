## 🧩 Concepts

Classification assigns inputs to one of several predefined categories. 
 
This module includes:

- Linear and probabilistic models - Logistic Regression
- Tree-based methods 
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Margin-based methods (SVM)
- Ensemble learning and bias–variance tradeoff
