## ðŸ§© Concepts

Clustering aims to discover inherent group structures in data **without predefined labels**.  

This module covers:

- **K-Means**: centroid-based clustering  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: tree-based grouping  
- **DBSCAN**: density-based clustering  
- Visualization and evaluation of cluster quality
