# 🎯 Recommender Systems

> Building systems that suggest relevant items to users based on behavior, preferences, or similarity.

## 🧩 Concepts

Recommender Systems are algorithms designed to personalize experiences by predicting user-item interactions.  
They are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, and Amazon.

**Core approaches:**
- **Collaborative Filtering:** based on user–item interactions  
- **Content-Based Filtering:** based on item or user attributes  
- **Hybrid Models:** combining both strategies  
- **Neural Recommenders:** leveraging embeddings and deep learning

## ⚙️ Implementation Plan

- [ ] Implement **Collaborative Filtering**
  - User–User and Item–Item similarity  
  - Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- [ ] Implement **Content-Based Filtering**
  - TF-IDF or embeddings for item similarity
- [ ] Build a **Hybrid Recommender**
  - Combine CF + Content-based scores
- [ ] Test a **Neural Collaborative Filtering** approach (optional)
- [ ] Evaluate with ranking metrics

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Precision@K / Recall@K  
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)  
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)  
- Coverage and diversity metrics

## 🧪 Experiments & Insights

- Impact of sparsity on collaborative methods  
- Comparing similarity metrics (cosine, Pearson)  
- Effect of embeddings on semantic similarity  
- Trade-off between personalization and diversity
