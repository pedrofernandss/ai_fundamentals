# üéØ Object Detection

> Moving beyond classification to **localizing and identifying multiple objects** within an image.

---

## üß© Concepts

Object Detection extends image classification by predicting *where* objects appear and *what* they are.  
It combines classification and regression in one framework.

Core topics:
- Sliding windows and region proposals  
- Anchor boxes and bounding boxes   
- Two-stage detectors (R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)  
- One-stage detectors (YOLO, SSD)  
- Data annotation and augmentation  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Plan

- [ ] Visualize bounding boxes and labels  
- [ ] Implement simple selective search proposal demo  
- [ ] Train or fine-tune Faster R-CNN (PyTorch)  
- [ ] Test YOLOv5 or SSD pretrained models  
- [ ] Measure IoU and mAP  
- [ ] Visualize detection outputs

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- mAP (mean Average Precision)  
- IoU (Intersection over Union)  
- Precision‚ÄìRecall Curve  
- FPS (Frames per Second)

## üß™ Experiments & Insights

- Compare one-stage vs two-stage detectors  
- Analyze detection confidence thresholds  
- Observe false positives and occlusions  
- Benchmark inference speed vs accuracy trade-offs
