# ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection

> Moving beyond classification to **localizing and identifying multiple objects** within an image.

## ðŸ§© Concepts

Object Detection combines **classification** and **localization** â€” predicting both *what* is in an image and *where* it is.  

This module explores:

- Sliding windows and region proposals  
- Anchor boxes and bounding boxes  
- Modern detection architectures (YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN)
