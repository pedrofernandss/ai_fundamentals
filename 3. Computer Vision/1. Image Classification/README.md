## 🧩 Concepts

Image classification is the foundation of computer vision — assigning labels to images based on their visual patterns.  

This module focuses on:

- CNN architectures and feature extraction
- Pooling, padding, and filters
- Training and regularization
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
