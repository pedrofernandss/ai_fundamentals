# 🖼️ Image Classification

> Teaching models to recognize and categorize images through convolutional representations.

---

## 🧩 Concepts

Image classification assigns a label to an image based on visual patterns.  
It’s the foundational problem of computer vision and the basis for object detection and segmentation.

Core topics:
- Pooling, padding, and filters  
- CNN architectures and feature extraction (LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet)  
- Training, regularization and augmentation  
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
