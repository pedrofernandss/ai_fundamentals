## ðŸ§© Concepts

Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) identifies instances that differ from the majority of the data.  
Used in:
- Fraud detection
- Fault monitoring
- Network intrusion
- Sensor reliability and time series analysis

Core approaches:
- Statistical (distribution-based)
- Distance / Density-based (KNN, Local Outlier Factor)
- Model-based (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
