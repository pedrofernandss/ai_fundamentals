## ðŸ§© Concepts

Deep Learning builds models that learn hierarchical feature representations.  

This module explores:

- The Perceptron and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Backpropagation and optimization
- Regularization and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Key training techniques and visualization
