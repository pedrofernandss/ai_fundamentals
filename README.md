# üß† Artificial Intelligence - The Fundamentals

This repository aims to **centralize and document my revisiting of AI fundamentals**, through small and focused implementations of core algorithms ‚Äî many of which I have studied before but now intend to **rebuild from scratch** for deeper understanding and review.

The goal is not just to reproduce results, but to strengthen intuition and maintain a personal reference for key areas in Artificial Intelligence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Philosophy

Each notebook or module includes:
- A short theoretical summary  
- Implementation from scratch (NumPy-based)  
- Comparison with modern frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, scikit-learn)  
- Visual or quantitative analysis of results  

This structure helps bridge **intuition ‚Üî implementation ‚Üî interpretation**.
