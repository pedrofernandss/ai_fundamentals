# ⏳ Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

> Modeling and predicting sequential data over time — from classical ARIMA to neural network approaches.

---

## 🧩 Concepts

Time series analysis focuses on patterns that evolve over time: **trend**, **seasonality**, and **noise**.  
Forecasting uses these patterns to predict future values.

**Core components:**
- Trend: long-term direction  
- Seasonality: repeating patterns  
- Residuals: random noise

## ⚙️ Implementation Plan

- [ ] Explore **data decomposition** (trend, seasonality, residual)
- [ ] Implement **ARIMA / SARIMA**
- [ ] Apply **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)**
- [ ] Build an **LSTM forecasting model**
- [ ] Experiment with **Temporal Fusion Transformer** (TFT)
- [ ] Evaluate forecasts and compare methods
